This is an additional module to be used with [ofxSoundObjects](https://github.com/roymacdonald/ofxSoundObjects/).

This addon was specifically made for using [ofxAudioUnit](https://github.com/roymacdonald/ofxAudioUnit) to allow you to use AudioUnits (AU) audio effects, pluggins and generators within a chain of ofxSoundObjects
